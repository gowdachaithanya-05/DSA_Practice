# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)  

This repository contains my journey of solving DSA problems from various platforms and curated lists. Below are the sources I'm currently using:  

## Platforms  
- **[GeeksforGeeks (GFG)](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/)**  
  - Solving problems to strengthen my fundamentals and practice implementation.  

- **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)**  
  - Focusing on LeetCode problems to prepare for technical interviews and improve problem-solving skills.  

## Curated Lists  
- **[LeetCode Top 150 Questions](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-150-liked-questions/)**  
  - Tackling the most frequently asked questions in interviews, covering a variety of topics.  

- **[Striver's DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/)**  
  - Following Striver's SDE sheet for a systematic approach to DSA preparation.
